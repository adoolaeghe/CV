I am currently looking for a Junior Developer role in London, where I can work on projects with others who are passionate about creating code.

Passionated about the relationships between 'art and science', I decided to attend the [Maker's Academy](http://employers.makersacademy.com/) course after graduating from a visual art degree. Now stepping into the development world, I enjoy the mix of analytical and creative associated to it. I value the opportunity to work and learn with people that have interests in creative tech.

## Skills

#### Self-driven learner

My university studies were focused on independent learning experiences, I was pushed to find the resources for my own learning giving me the freedom and opportunity to study a large array of fields and subjects (ranging from ). The iniative learning at Makers Academy allowed me to build project with complexe technology such as Blockchain application...

#### Critical thinking

Working as an art curators, I have an eye and passion for staging artwork in a way that creates interest in an art exhibition. I’ve trained myself to identifying the relevant part of someone's idea or production, producing the holistic meaning of an exhibition. I enjoy thinking this way when programming allowing me to separate or broke into parts problems to discover their nature, functions and relationships.

#### Team-Player

I have worked in a variety of context sharpening my interpersonal skills. I like to work in between conflicts, allowing flexibility that can lead to new approaches for a solution. At Makers Academy, I intentionally decided to work in a group when given the opportunity,    

#### Communication

My good communication with my team was critical to my role in a contemporary art gallery, I had focused on facilitating visitor engagement with the work displayed at the gallery. I had to publicly speak regularly in front of relatively large audience. I can fluently speak in french and english :fr::gb:
