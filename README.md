Passionated about the relationship between the arts and technology, I decided to attend the [Maker's Academy](http://employers.makersacademy.com/) course after graduating from a visual art degree. Now stepping into the development world, I enjoy the mix of analysis and creativity associated with it. I would value the opportunity to work and learn with people that have an interest in innovative problem-solving.

## Skills

#### Critical thinking

Working as an art curator, I have an eye and passion for staging artwork in a way that creates interest in an art exhibition. I’ve trained myself to identifying the relevant part of someone's idea or production to outline the holistic meaning of an exhibition. This approach has been especially helpful when learning to code, allowing me to separate problems into parts that I understand helping to solve their nature and solution.

#### Self-driven learner

My university studies were focused on independent learning experiences. I was pushed to find the resources for my own learning, having the freedom and opportunity to study a large array of fields and subjects (ranging from video animation to marble carving !). With the learning culture at Makers Academy, I show my willingness to take on difficult challenges, deciding to build projects with complex technology such as [Blockchain application](https://github.com/adoolaeghe/Love-Block).

#### Communication

My communication with my team was critical in my role in a contemporary art gallery, I had to facilitate the visitor engagement with the work displayed and regularly speak publicly to present the exhibiton in front of potential collectors. This strength was particularly beneficial during my final project when working on a team with 3 other developers. 
I can also fluently speak in french and english :fr::gb:

#### Team-Player

I have worked in a variety of contexts sharpening my interpersonal skills. I am good at reaching a compromise, allowing flexibility that can lead to new approaches for finding a solution. At Makers Academy, I intentionally decided to work in groups when given the opportunity, adding a crucial dimension and motivation to my learning.
